He's been known to attend some of their soccer matches. He recounts a game he attended against Newell's Old Boys (Messi's first club). As he was leaving the stadium, Newell fans began to throw objects at the opposing fans. One opposing fan notices him and yells out, \"Hey Actor Puto! Why don't you put on the ring and disappear!\" He immediately fell to his knees in laughter. \nSassy Cassie: Viggo???
