He recounts a game he attended against Newell’s Old Boys (Messi’s first club). As he was leaving the stadium, Newell fans began to throw objects at the opposing fans. One opposing fan notices him and yells out, “Hey Actor Puto! Why don’t you put on the ring and disappear!” He immediately fell to his knees in laughter.\nSassy Cassie | Viggo??? Whaaaaa?",

Liz’s raw yet catchy love letter with spacey metaphors hits with a bright, solar-flare punch.\nNacho | This was a tough one to score. Initially I liked it, but after a few more listens I was like, this isn’t good… the final few listens and I ended up slightly digging it",
